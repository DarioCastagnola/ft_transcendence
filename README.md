# ft\_transcendence

## Overview

**ft\_transcendence** is the final Common Core project of **42 Ã‰cole**, aiming to create a web application based on the famous Pong game. This project required adherence to strict prerequisites, which can be found in the project [subject](./backend/en.subject.pdf), and the selection of various features/modules to implement. Our implementation includes a modern tech stack and advanced functionalities to provide an engaging user experience.

## Features Implemented

We selected and implemented the following features:

- **Backend Framework:** Built with Django for robustness and scalability.
- **Frontend Framework:** Developed using Bootstrap for a responsive and modern UI.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for efficient data management.
- **User Management & Authentication:** Standard user authentication, tournament-based user tracking.
- **AI Opponent:** A challenging AI to play against.
- **User & Game Stats Dashboards:** Real-time tracking of user and game statistics.
- **Security Enhancements:** Implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT for secure authentication.
- **Remote Authentication:** Allowing users to authenticate remotely.
- **Microservices Architecture:** The backend is designed using microservices principles for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Advanced 3D Techniques:** Enhancing gameplay with 3D visual effects.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring support across various modern browsers.
